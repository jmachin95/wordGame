# wordGame

This is a simple word game that prompts a user to enter a word given a starting word. The user must enter a valid word defined by a number of given rules.
If the word given by the user is invalid then an error message will be shown and the user will be prompted for a valid word until one is given. If nothing is 
entered by the user, the user will be asked if they want to play again and the game will restart. If the user enters a word that has previously been entered,
the game will end and the user's score will be shown. If the user correctly enters 30 valid words, the user wins.

I understand that there will be some bad programming techniques shown in this first project of mine but any help or advice of any kind is greatly appreciated as I am always looking to further develop my skills and knowledge!
